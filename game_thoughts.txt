I would propose that we do that following for this course:

1. Do the exact same game (twice) one with Unity and then with Real Engine.
The reason for this is twofold. First, we don't have to re-invent the wheel,
and can just use our first idea twice - saving time. Secondly, it will be
that much easier at the end of the course when we are asked to compare
the two engines.

Sophie had suggested we do a 2d game, which I am not opposed to, and would likely
be easier, which I am always in favor of. So, unless Darwin strongly opposes
I suggest we go with that.

So, unless I am mistaken, the specifications are translated (for me) in the
adjacent file (game-specifications.txt). Please correct if I am wrong.

As per, "Game idea" I have had a lot of random thoughts. Here are some games
from the past that I looked up, that seem to be applicable (more or less).

The Gauntlet
Super Mario brothers
The Legend of Zelda

I have also thought perhaps something along the lines a "Pokemon" themed game.
I don't know anything about Pokemon to be honest, but like have a little yellow
ball (for starters) named Pikachu, and he just goes through a map
kill any or random monsters (cubes for starters) and loots various powerups.

Naturally, we could just do a generic "adventurer" who does that same. Gaining
powers as he levels up, and gets to the end (or dies, if he is REALLY lousy, I
expect the game to be easy).

So, in sum, whatever you guys vote for, let me know and I will email Thereza
our idea.
